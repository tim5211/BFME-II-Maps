Lore – Echoes of War
Forged by ancient powers to test the will of warlords.
Each ring whispers of long-forgotten sieges and shattered alliances.
Springs still flow through cratered scars, remnants of power untamed.
Now, the land stirs once more — and only one will rule its circles of power.
But beware the lurking shadow… for Gollum roams, and the ring awaits a master.
